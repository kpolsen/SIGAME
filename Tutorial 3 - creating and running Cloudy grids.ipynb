    "# Tutorial 3 - creating and running Cloudy grids\n",
    "The 3rd step of SIGAME is to run the Cloudy photo-ionization code for a grid with parameters that span the range found in your simulated galaxies.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**This step requires that you install Cloudy and depending on how many grid cells you want to run, i.e. the resolution of the final Cloudy look-up table, you may need access to HPC facilities**. Because of all the complexities in writing and executing Cloudy, this tutorial does not go into too much detail, but rather gives an overview of how you *would* execute SIGAME. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can also skip this tutorial and go to the next, by downloading a pre-calculated Cloudy look-up table for the z=0 case here (look for the file starting with `lookup_table...`):\n",

    "https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1vl4nKDOUJ-T2zvUn5I0Otzy_OqakZOSQ?usp=sharing\n",
    "\n",
    "This file should be moved to the `SIGAME/look-up-table/cloudy/` folder where you can safely overwrite the existing file. Due to the size limit of GitHub releases, the full table is not included in the release itself, and the existing table is only a dummy of very small size."
